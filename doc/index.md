# Benchmarks

In the following benchmarks we have some setup that makes the environment look
more like a real world deployment. Facts are gathered for all hosts, but
delegated to localhost. We also have some group variables taken from the Kolla
Ansible project. This should help to model the effect of variables on
performance.

* [include and import](include-and-import.md)
* [template](template.md)
* [run once](run-once.md)
* [skip](skip.md)
* [notify](notify.md)
